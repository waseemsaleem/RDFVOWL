Rdfexplorer:
1. Draggable elements from left side bar.
2. Search
3. Displaying property details on the right side upon selecting an item.

WebVOWL:
1. The toggle layout of the left side bar.
2. Creating selected property links between 2 class elements.
3. Creating selected literal on clicking the green '+' button on the class element.
4. Deletion of the element and it's attached subclasses.
5. Exporting the drawn knowledge graph to a ttl file consisting of OWL ontology.

And also instead of using pug files, can you make this in HTML instead. Even if it's entire page in one file like the WebVOWL project it's fine.
